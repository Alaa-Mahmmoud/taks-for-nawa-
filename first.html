        <h4 ><b>Exotic dance moves</b></h4>
        yes, you are right! As part of my post-doctorate work ,<i>I did </i> study tribal 
            dance. To answer your question, my favourite dance are as follows, with defintion :
            <h5>Polynesian chicken dance</h5>
            A little known but <i>very </i>influential dance dating back as far as 300BC
            , awhole village would dance around in a circle like chickens, to
            encourage their livestock to be "fruitful". 
            <h5>Icelandic browing shuffle</h5>
            Before thr Iclanders developed fire as a means of getting warm,
            they used to practice this dance, which involved hudding close together in 
            a circle on the floor,and shuffling their nbodies around in imperceptibly
            tiny ,very rapid movments. One of my fellow students used to say that he thought 
        this dance inspired modern styles such as Twerking.
        <h5>Arctic robot dance</h5>
        An interesting exaple of historic misinformation, English explores in the 
        1960<sub>s</sub> belevied to have discovered a new dance style characterised
        by "robotic" , stilled movments, being practiced by inhabitants of Northern 
        Alaska and Canada. Later on however it was discovered that they were just 
        moving like this because they were really cold .
